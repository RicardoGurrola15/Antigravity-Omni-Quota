**Antigravity Omni-Quota** is a high-performance VS Code extension designed to provide a unified, secure, and multi-platform dashboard for monitoring Antigravity AI quotas. 

Unlike standard tools that only show the current session, **Omni-Quota** acts as a central hub for all your accounts, allowing you to track quotas, remaining credits, and reset periods across multiple identities in a single interface.

## 🌟 What's New in v1.1.5 (Precision Update)

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🚀 Zero-Config Discovery**: Automatic detection of Antigravity's internal API port and CSRF token.
- **🎯 Surgical Account Tracking**: Reads your IDE's core profile (`google_accounts.json`) to pinpoint your exact active account, bypassing ghost-process confusion.
- **🕒 Real-Time Precision**: True 0% detection for disabled models, and intelligent `Ready 🟢` states that hide unnecessary countdowns when your quota is fully restored.
- **🔗 Multi-Account Hub**: Store and monitor all your Antigravity accounts simultaneously. No more logging in and out just to check your limits.
